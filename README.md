# Getting more out of 1:1s with your manager

In your 1:1 document, create a section titled "If we have extra time.." and consider talking about some of these things:

### Getting to know each other

* What motivates you
* What you want to do longer-term
* What skills you’re interested in growing
* What kinds of activities give you energy
* What makes you excited to come to work
* What deflates you and makes you unexcited to come to work
* How you like to receive positive and constructive feedback
* How you build trust in work relationships
* Your “laundry SLOs” — your burnout indicators

### Learn about the how things work around here

* What it means to be a strong performer at any given IC grade level
* How the promotion process works
* How salary adjustments, bonuses, and RSUs are determined
* Things that are happening at the department level
* How (some) decisions are made outside of our group
* Available stretch opportunities on your squad, on other squads, and outside of Communities
* People who have specific skillsets, especially outside of your squad
